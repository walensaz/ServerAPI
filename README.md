# ServerAPI
A server API that uses sockets :)
A server API I made in java using sockets and writers.  You can make a couple different types of servers, like MultiConnectionServer for multiple clients on one server, or a SingleConnectionServer which allows for only one connection on the server at a time, or MultiConnectionFast which is a server that gives each connection its own thread to update on, therefore it has its own client option and is a little harder to setup.  Though all of these are pretty easy to setup.
